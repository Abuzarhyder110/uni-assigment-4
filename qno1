#Question 1: Crop Monitoring System
#Imagine you are developing a Crop Monitoribg System for farmers. Write python function
#moniter_crop(temperature, humidity, rainfall) that takes enviromental conditions as input and returns 
#"Watering needed" if the humidity is low and rainfall is below average, and "Optimal conditions" otherwise.

t = float(input("Enter temperature: "))
h = input("Enter humidity(low/high): ").lower()
r = input("Enter rainfall (high/low(below average)):").lower()

def moniter_crop(temperature, humidity, rainfall):
    if humidity == "low" and rainfall == "low":
        print("Watering needed")
    else:
        print("Optimal conditions")

moniter_crop(t, h, r)
