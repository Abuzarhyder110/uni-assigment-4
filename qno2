#Question 2:Library Book Reservation System
#Design a python program for a library book reservation system. Create a function
#reserve_book(book_title, student_status) that allows students to reserve a book. If the book is available 
#and the student is regular student, reserve the book: if the student is VIP student, provide instant
#reservation. Hamdle cases where the book is not available.

books = ["book1","book2","book3","book4","book5"]
print(books)
bn = input("Enter book name from the aboves : ")
n = input("Enter your name : ")
status = input("Enter your status : Vip or avg : ").lower()

attendance = float(input("Enter your attendance : 0-100 : "))

def reserve_book(book_title,student_status):
    global books 
    if bn not in books:
       print("not found")
    elif attendance < 50:
       print("cant assign book")
    elif status == "vip":
       print("here is your book")
    else:
       print("Wait 10 minutes to find the book")

reserve_book(bn,status)
